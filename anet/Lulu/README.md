Lulu's ActivityNet Folder

I've ran two experiments for ActivityNet
One with learning rate=0.0004,
         lr_update_every=150,
         batch_size=128,
         epoch=600,
         and frames=32, the results are in 0429.txt and scores_429.log (upload on google drive).
The other with lr= 0.00004,
               batch_size = 128,
               lr_update_every = 150,
               epoch = 1500,
               and frames = 32, we cut the dataset to be the half, and simplify the the vocabulary for the translation to be 4961.
               The results are in 0513.txt and scores_0513.log. pkl file is also generated as 2021-05-13anet_eric_32f_1500_nocontra_Separate_vpmt.pkl.
